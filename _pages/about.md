I am a third-year undergraduate student from [School of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering](https://www.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/),[Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I major in Information Engineering. My research interest includes computer vision, computer graphic and machine learning. In detail, I am specially interested in Artificial Intelligence Genrated Content(AIGC) and Humon Motion Generation(MoGen). Recently, I am working on Hand-Object Interaction Reconstruction and a significant dataset on sign language.

From July, 2023 till now, I have worked with [Liang Xu](https://liangxuy.github.io/) on topics of human motion. 

In December, 2023, I was very excited to be accepted into AIGCClass@SIC and under the supervision of [Yichao Yan](https://daodaofr.github.io/), the AI Institute of Shanghai Jiao Tong University and [Weiming Zhao](https://zwm0426.github.io), the Student Innovation Center of Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 

In [AIGCClass](https://sjtu-aigc.github.io/), I have worked with other fellows on some fashion topics, our project: CyberLife, have been qualified as the golden prize in China International College Students' Innovation Competition 2024 (CICSIC), Shanghai (which is ranked 2nd in all awesome projects). And now our project have been incubated by [miricleplus (YC China)](https://www.miracleplus.com/), as [emagen](emagen.cn).

This autumn, I will also be invited as an interviewer for the recruitment of AIGCClass2024 Members. I am looking forward to having deep connection with fresh-hand for AIGC!
